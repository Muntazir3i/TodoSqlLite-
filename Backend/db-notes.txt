/*Creates a connection to a SQLite database.

 File Name: todo.db

 If todo.db exists → it opens it.

 If todo.db doesn't exist → it creates it automatically.

 const db = ...

 db is now your live database connection object.

 You will use db to send SQL commands like create tables, insert todos, fetch todos, etc.*/




 /*
 
  
db.prepare(...)
prepare():

Tells SQLite:

"Get ready to run this SQL command."

It parses the SQL string.

It creates an internal statement (but doesn't execute it yet).

.prepare() = Load the gun.


SQL inside prepare:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS todos (...)
CREATE TABLE:

Try to create a new table in the database.

IF NOT EXISTS:

If the todos table already exists, don't throw an error — just do nothing.

todos:

Name of the table you are making.



Columns inside todos:

Column	Type	Meaning
id	INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT	- Unique ID for each todo item.
- Increments automatically (1,2,3,4...).
text	TEXT NOT NULL	- The actual todo content (like "Buy milk").
- Cannot be empty.
done	BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0	- True/False value.
- 0 means not done.
- By default, todos are not completed when added.




.run()
run():

Actually executes the prepared statement.

.run() = Pull the trigger on the loaded SQL gun.

No return data — you just tell the database:

"Make sure the table is ready."
